# Lottery Number Selector

The native app version of the 'Lottery Number Picker' coded in Python. Simply picks 6 numbers at random for use with the 'National Lottery' Lotto draw.

## Installation

It is currently portable and downloadable via the 'dist' folder when you download the whole thing as a ZIP file, so no need for installation. Just simply run the .exe file in the
'dist' folder.

## Usage

Click the big, green 'Generate Numbers' button and watch your winning numbers be generated before your very eyes in the yellow panel above. If you're not happy with the numbers generated, just click 'Generate More Numbers' for six different numbers. You can continue to do this until you're satisfied with the numbers produced.

## Roadmap

This project is currently in it's early stages and is somewhat usable but there is definitely room for a lot more improvement. Future ideas are listed below:

- Ability for users to customise elements of the interface, such as the colour scheme, size of the widgets, size of the app, etc

- Ability to draw numbers for various other 'National Lottery' games and even lottery numbers for games in different countries

- Some snazzy sound effects (maybe)

## Contributing

This project is not currently open to contributions but it might be sometime in the future, so watch this space.

## Authors and acknowledgment

Have to thank me (Matthew Aileru), myself (Matthew Aileru) and I (Matthew Aileru) for this. Honestly, where would this project be without those three, eh?
